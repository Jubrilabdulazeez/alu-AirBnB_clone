To start and use the ccommand Interpreter:

Import the necessary modules and classes from the models package.
Create an instance of the HBNBCommand class, which is a subclass of cmd.Cmd.
Set the prompt attribute to "(hbnb) ", which will be the command prompt displayed to the user.
Override the emptyline method to do nothing when the user enters an empty line.
Override the default method to handle invalid commands. Check if the command has the format "<class>.<command>(<args>)" and call the corresponding method if it exists.
Define methods to handle specific commands such as "quit", "show", "destroy", "all", "count", and "update". Implement the desired functionality for each command.
Call the cmdloop() method on the HBNBCommand instance to start the command prompt and enter the interactive loop.
Using this console, you can interact with the HBnB application by entering commands to create, retrieve, update, and delete instances of different classes.

Here are some example commands you can use in the console:

create BaseModel: Create a new instance of the BaseModel class and print its ID.
show BaseModel 123: Display the string representation of the BaseModel instance with ID 123.
destroy BaseModel 123: Delete the BaseModel instance with ID 123.
all: Display the string representations of all instances of all classes.
all BaseModel: Display the string representations of all instances of the BaseModel class.
count BaseModel: Retrieve the number of instances of the BaseModel class.
update BaseModel 123 name "New Name": Update the name attribute of the BaseModel instance with ID 123 to "New Name".
